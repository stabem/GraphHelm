# Specification Changelog

## Production Event and Evidence Store — 2026-08-12

- Decisions D-035, D-036, and D-037 accepted with ADR-021 through ADR-023: authoring and persistence are distinct representations, the Governor externalizes free-form content as encrypted Evidence, and required content that is unavailable blocks execution.
- Safe persistence projection design and a focused Event/Evidence Store threat model added.
- Single pre-release schema baseline `1.0.0` rebuilt with 15 contracts, adding `PersistedGraphVersion`, event envelope, Evidence record, artifact reference, repository scope, and sensitivity; the intermediate release `1.1.0` removed.
- Eleven typed content positions registered, including the `context_path`, `permission_path`, and `isolation_path` authoring scopes.
- Local JSONL repository and PostgreSQL adapter implemented against one wire contract, with forced row-level security, transaction-local scope, authenticated stream heads and integrity checkpoints, and least-privilege runtime roles.
- Encrypted Evidence, sealed local key provider, authenticated revocation journal, legal holds, and auditable cryptographic erasure implemented.
- Disposable projection generations, fail-closed executable materialization, encrypted streaming backup, and verified restore implemented.
- Operator commands `events verify`, `events rebuild`, `events backup`, and `events restore` added, with bounded JSON configuration and out-of-band key material.
- No legacy compatibility layer: superseded event formats, importers, dual readers, and fallback branches removed before the first public release. Existing developer repositories and databases must be deleted and recreated.
- Milestone documentation and operational procedures published; the specification version remains 0.1.1.
