//! `GET /v1/executions/{id}/tasks`, the MCP tool `tasks` and `graphhelm execution status --tasks`
//! (#1149, optimization plan A1): the Runtime opens an execution's sealed `task.*` envelopes,
//! keeps the ones that verify, and serves `graphhelm_execution::tasks::fold_task_events` over them.
//!
//! What verifies: the recorded event has exactly one evidence reference, naming the envelope
//! `signal-<signalId>`; the sealed content's digest is the one the event recorded; the envelope
//! opens with the Runtime's keyring; its `type` is the recorded kind and its `source.id` is the
//! actor that recorded it; and its description parses as a `graphhelm-task-event-v1` document for
//! that kind naming that actor. Anything else is counted in `rejected` and never drawn, which is
//! how the Studio read its own fold (`readTaskEventRecords`), so an old log folds the same here.
