.SYNOPSIS
    Runs the complete GraphHelm verification gate locally.

.DESCRIPTION
    This is the authoritative gate. The project does not run hosted CI, so nothing verifies a change
    unless it is run here. Treat a red gate exactly as you would a red pipeline: do not merge.

    The gate is ordered cheapest-first so an obvious failure is reported early, but a failing stage
    does NOT stop the run: every stage executes regardless, so one invocation reports every failure
    rather than only the first. The script exits non-zero if any stage failed, zero if every stage
    passed - verified directly by running the exit-code logic against a forced failure and a clean
    pass (see the PR that closed https://github.com/stabem/GraphHelm/issues/97).

    THE SAFE PATTERN, when you need to check the exit code: redirect the run to a file, check the
    exit code of THAT SAME COMMAND immediately, then read the file separately - never pipe the
    live run into anything if the exit code matters.
        From PowerShell:
            ./ci/gate.ps1 > gate.log 2>&1; echo "exit: $LASTEXITCODE"; Get-Content gate.log -Tail 50
        From bash (invoking the PowerShell host directly, no pipe on the invocation itself):
            powershell.exe -File ci/gate.ps1 > gate.log 2>&1; echo "exit: $?"; tail -50 gate.log
    Both read the exit code from the command that produced it, then inspect the FILE afterward -
    a completely separate step with no bearing on `$?`/`$LASTEXITCODE`, however it gets filtered.

    DO NOT PIPE THIS SCRIPT'S LIVE OUTPUT (e.g. `./ci/gate.ps1 | tail -50`,
    `powershell.exe -File ci/gate.ps1 | tail -50`) if you intend to check its exit code afterward.
    In bash/POSIX shells, `$?` after a pipe reflects the LAST command in the pipe (`tail`, here),
    never this script's - the exit code you read back is the pager's, not the gate's, and a
    genuinely red run reads as success. This is not a bug in this script; it is how pipes work,
    and no script on the producing end of one can fix it from the inside. (Issue #97, found live:
    the exact pipe-through-tail pattern above produced a RED banner with an apparently-successful
    exit status, twice in one day.)

.PARAMETER SkipPostgres
    Skips the ignored PostgreSQL matrix. Use only when a change cannot touch persistence, and say so
    when reporting the result - a gate run without it is not a full gate.

.PARAMETER PostgresBin
    Passed through to ci/postgres.ps1 as GRAPHHELM_PG_BIN. Required unless PostgreSQL is discoverable
    on this machine.

.EXAMPLE
    ./ci/gate.ps1
    ./ci/gate.ps1 -PostgresBin 'C:\pgsql\bin'
    ./ci/gate.ps1 -SkipPostgres

# Two hazards make the obvious invocations wrong. Calling it with `&` propagates its `exit` and
# terminates this script. Letting it inherit this script's output handles is worse: the PostgreSQL
# server it spawns inherits them too and holds them open, so if the gate's own output is redirected
# to a file the parent blocks forever on a stream that never closes. Giving the child explicit
# temporary files of its own closes both, and `WaitForExit` waits for that process alone rather than
# for its descendants - the server is stopped by postgres.ps1's own teardown before it returns.
